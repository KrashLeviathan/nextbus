nextbus
  - Description:
      This program interfaces with a database to display NextBus
      information for CyRide in Ames, IA. It can return bus route
      information in a variety of formats, based on user input of
      route, stop, etc. The user is also able to configure the
      program so that they can quickly find out the time of the
      next bus heading home or the time of the next bus heading
      to school/work without having to manually type all the
      optional parameters.
  - Usage:
      ./nextbus
