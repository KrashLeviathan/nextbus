# Contributing

This project is open to contributions! I've posted issues for some of
the things that need to be tackled, but the list is not exhaustive. Fork
the repo and create a new branch if you plan on contributing a feature or
fixing a bug. Then create a pull request into the repo once it's ready to
be merged.
